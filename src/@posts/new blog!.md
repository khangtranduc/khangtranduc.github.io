Welcome to my blog, finally figured out how to set it up statically so that I can host it for free on Github Pages.

I plan to use this as a platform to catalog various projects that I will (hopefully) embark on in the near future. 

Iâ€™m thinking about doing **a project a week**, inspired by Carter Semrad on YouTube:

Well, I wish myself luck on this journey as I will surely need it. 

*Expect cool things! (hopefully)*
