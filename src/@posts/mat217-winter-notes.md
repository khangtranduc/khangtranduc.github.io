## first installment!
Finally, the first installment of my [quest to do a project a week](/posts/new%20blog!). During planning, I realized that I didn‚Äôt have nearly enough time in the winter to do all the things I wanted. So I resorted to doing one project per division (which I defined to be 3 days). At least that was the original plan.

I initially planned to work through 5 chapters of Axler in 3 days which, needless to say, I didn‚Äôt not succeed. This was because of numerous outings, delays, over-estimation of my abilities, and laziness. Nevertheless, I was at least still able to finish 2 chapters in a week, which is faithful (somewhat) to the original goal of weekly projects, though a lot less impressive.

I hope to speed things up from here on out. Fingers crossed ü§û.
## winter notes
Anyways, I have prepared a few pages of ‚Äúwinter notes‚Äù summarizing what I have learnt from the book, as well as a few exercises that I thought were cool (I did do the rest, but just too lazy to type them all out).
