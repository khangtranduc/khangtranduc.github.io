During planning, I realized that I didn‚Äôt have nearly enough time in the winter to do all the things I wanted. So I resorted to doing one project per division (which I defined to be 3 days). At least that was the original plan.</p> <p>I initially planned to work through 5 chapters of Axler in 3 days which, needless to say, I didn‚Äôt not succeed. This was because of numerous outings, delays, over-estimation of my abilities, and laziness. Nevertheless, I was at least still able to finish 2 chapters in a week, which is faithful (somewhat) to the original goal of weekly projects, though a lot less impressive.</p> <p>I hope to speed things up from here on out. Fingers crossed ü§û.</p> <h2>winter notes</h2> <p>Anyways, I have prepared a few pages of ‚Äúwinter notes‚Äù summarizing what I have learnt from the book, as well as a few exercises that I thought were cool (I did do the rest, but just too lazy to type them all out).</p> <p>You can find my winter notes here: <a href="/downloads/MAT_217_winter_notes.pdf" target="‚Äù_blank‚Äù">MAT 217 Winter Notes (Ch. 1 & 2)</a></p> <!>',1);function k(t){var e=u(),a=h(d(e),14);c(a,{pdfUrl:"/downloads/MAT_217_winter_notes.pdf"}),s(t,e)}export{k as default,A as metadata};
